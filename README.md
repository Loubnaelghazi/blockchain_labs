# blockchain_labs

This repository contains my blockchain labs, supervised by Prof. Ikram BENADBELOUAHAB, where I explore the fundamentals of blockchain technology, including implementations of Proof of Work, blocks, chains, and more. The labs aim to provide practical insights into how blockchain systems operate, with varying hash difficulty levels and performance analysis."
